# Sanchez-et-al.-2019-New-Phytologist
# These were the workflows for solving several bioinformatic analysis for Sanchez et al. (2019) New Phytologist.
# I used standard open-source software in Linux command-line, and custom-made python scripts (I kept here the original names of the python 
# script's files to match my records)
# It may also involve some manual organization of files, manual assessment of results and manual processing to reach final results.
# Although it solved the problems faced at the time, note that this is a beginner's code, as I'm not a professional bioinformatician or data
# scientist.
# As such, it may probably look overly complicated; and other more advanced solutions are likely simpler or more effective.
# The workflow may also displays some historical contingencies, as I'm learning while doing.
# None of this work would be possible without the kind bioinformatics support of Varodom Charoensawan, Hugo Tavares, Jeremy Gruel,
# Hajk-Georg Drost, Anna Gogleva and Yassin Refahi. The last R scrip was kindly shared by Marco Catoni.
